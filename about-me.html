      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img class="intro" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/1dd62bab-0f92-41c9-8ff0-08121253dc11%2Fme.jpg?1547098982630" alt="Me and my gorgeous wife, Hannah!">
      <h2 class="myname">Ryan</h2>
      <p>Well, my name is Ryan. I am a CIT major and I would really love to become and Agile Coach or some sort of framework leader within the Agile Software Development world. Currently, I am in my second semester as a student here at BYU-Idaho and work as a TA/Tutor for the CIT111 Intro to Databases Class.</p>

        I am so happy to be married to my best friend of all time (pictured next to me above), Hannah! :) We've been married for two years and are having the time of our lives here in Rexburg. I was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and have many quotes and scriptures that I would consider to be my favorites.
        I think that I am going to have to say that my current favorite scripture is Mosiah 2: 17. It says:</p>

      <div class="scriptureHolder">
        When you are in the service of your fellow beings, ye are only in the service of your God.

        One thing that you might find interesting (or annoying) about me is that I love to play the piano and the organ.
        I've been playing piano when I was 6 and picked up the organ when I was on my mission. I just think music has a way of speaking to people better than people speaking to people.

        Anyways, I am so excited to be in this course with y'all, and hope to learn a ton from you!
