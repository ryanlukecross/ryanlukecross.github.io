        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us
•	Rivers We Run
•	Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
