            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
            Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the
            River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
            number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
            rugged beauty of the river that they never left. Herds of elk and
            deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn
            sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
            with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches
            in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
            Lets not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. the Salmon
            is one of the longest un-damned rivers in the United States. As a
            free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
            are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to
            swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most
            desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty
            Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
            scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile
            trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green
            River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
            formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and
            great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III
            and is usually done in 6 days Desolation Canyon has been recognized
            as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness
            and rich history that the canyon tells.

              This is the Grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
              river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
              Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
              breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
              experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
              whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
              accessible only by river. CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a
              unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
              technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide
              variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are
              familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often
              refer to both.
